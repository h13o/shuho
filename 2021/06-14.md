## 🔥 Work

### 🧹 Tidy up programs like a shared room, not like a private room.

When I edit our companies' programs, sometimes I find some functions are not in use, and folder name is still using old, unrelevant name for current workflows. This is the time to do refactoring, and I think abotut the Boy Scout Rule of Uncle Bob, “Leave Things BETTER than you found them.” I sometimes talk about this to my Japanese coworkers, but it is not easy for Japanese to imagine the situation of Boy Scout, or camping. So, I come up another metaphor, which is Shared Room Rule. If the program is your own personal project, you don't have to keep things tidy everyday, you can put some garbage in the corner, and you can leave your clothes on the floor. BUT, if it is a shared room, you need to make rules to put what to where, and keep it tidy for next person. I hope this metaphor is a litte more making sense!

## 🌱 Life

### ⏳ Eat Slow

I usually eat food, so fast. Everyone eating with me for the first time gasps how fast I eat. And now, I have to change it. After taking an annual health checkup, I found my blood sugar is a little bit high. I'm working out a lot, sleep well, and there are few things which might be related to high blood sugar, but eating fast is. So nowadays, I spend 20 minutes for every meal. Before eating slowly, I've thought I'm a big eater, but I'm actually not! After 5 minutes from a first bite, I feel barely full, and never feel to do "Okawari". I'll continue this habit, and write it up some changes!  

### 🍈 Here Comes Melon!
Yubari Melon is Hokkaido's very popular brand! Really soft and sweet!

## ✍ Study

### 📝 VScode to NeoVim Challenge
I'm used to use VScode with vim extension for a year. I like most of the combination, but I would like to explore more ability of the vim and, so I'm now trying to switch to neovim. With Ben Awad's video, I understand most of the VScode features are available in neovim.
