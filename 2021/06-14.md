### ��  Eat Slow

I usually eat food, so fast. Everyone eating with me for the first time gasps how fast I eat. And now, I have to change it. After taking an annual health checkup, I found my blood sugar is a little bit high. I'm working out a lot, sleep well, and there are few things which might be related to high blood sugar, but eating fast is. So nowadays, I spend 20 minutes for every meal. Before eating slowly, I've thought I'm a big eater, but I'm actually not! After 5 minutes from a first bite, I feel barely full, and never feel to do "Okawari". I'll continue this habit, and write it up some changes!
