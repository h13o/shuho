### 🇨🇩 An intern from DR Congo!

In near future, we will welcome a new intern from Congo. He has lived in Japan already for 3 years, and started to learn programming. It'll be great if he learn a lot in IZA. By the way, when he visited our office with his friend, he told me interesting stories of the black business in Congo. He told me Congo has many rare materials like Gold, Cobalt, and Diamond, and those business owners have their business territories and armies. Especially the are producing Gold and Cobalt are really dangerous so never should go closer.

## ✍ Study

### ⚙ Studying Rust language

I learned C++ for competitive programming and Arduino part-time job, and I've thought I would like to continue this learning step. I found Rust when I thought about that, and it looks having cool memory management systems and many other features, so I decided to learn it. I'm learning from this online book, [RustCoder ―― AtCoder と Rust で始める競技プログラミング入門 (IN JAPANESE)](https://zenn.dev/toga/books/rust-atcoder) to how to solve competitive programming problems using Rust.
