# You should hide your keyboard!
Just a year ago, I decided to hide keyboard characters, because I mistakenly bought a mac with JIS keyboard, and hate seeing Japanese Kana on the key anymore. Most Japanese and I type Japanese using Roma-ji input, not Kana Input, so it is totally useless information for me. And I bought [this sheet](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%96%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A2%E3%82%A6%E3%83%88%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC-Mac-15mm-MBP-2015-JIS%E7%94%A8/dp/B016OVHROU). I was already happy, but I found another great side effects. My typing speed has improved. I thought I had already mastered touch typing at that time, but actually not. Just after hiding my keyboard, I noticed I look my keyboard every 5 sec. And after a week, thanks to this sheet, the habit disappeared! So, I'm now encouraging this sheet to my colleagues, at first, my co-founder. He also improved his typing score with technique! So we have decided to strongly recommend hiding keyboards for our team. That's the story!

### 🍸 Umeshu
I made Umeshu("梅酒", Japanese apricot wine). After a year, I can drink, but I may taste it before. 😋

## ✍ Study

### 🚀 Preparing for Isucon
[Isucon](https://isucon.net/) is a contest which competes web tuning skills. I teamed up with [@yuasabe](https://github.com/yuasabe), a master student of UTokyo, previously CTO of Gracia! He has much more knowledge about CS and Web services, and I'm really happy to learn from him a lot.

### 📚 Subscribe O'reilly
In my company, started to subscribe O'reilly with ACM(Association for Computing Machinery) License! There are more than 50,000 contents around computer science, and I'm excited to learn a lot from here. Here are some books I'm now reading.

* How Linux Works, 3rd Edition By Brian Ward
* CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide, Fourth Edition, 4th Edition


### ✌️ Tdd with Golang!
I found [learn-go-with-tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) for my study. This is two of the most interested topics for me. TDD and Golang. I'll go through this soon.
