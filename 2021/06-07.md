### Umeshu
I made Umeshu("梅酒", Japanese apricot wine). After a year, I can drink, but I may taste it before. 😋

## ✍ Study
In my company, started to subscribe O'reilly with ACM(Association for Computing Machinery) License! This is an amazing service and I'm excited to learn a lot from here.

### ✌️ Tdd with Golang!
I found [learn-go-with-tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) for my study.
This is two of the most interested topics for me. TDD and Golang.
