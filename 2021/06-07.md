### 🍸 Umeshu
I made Umeshu("梅酒", Japanese apricot wine). After a year, I can drink, but I may taste it before. 😋

## ✍ Study

### 🚀 Preparing for Isucon
[Isucon](https://isucon.net/) is a contest which competes web tuning skills. I teamed up with [@yuasabe](https://github.com/yuasabe), a master student of UTokyo, previously CTO of Gracia! He has much more knowledge about CS and Web services, and I'm really happy to learn from him a lot.

### 📚 Subscribe O'reilly
In my company, started to subscribe O'reilly with ACM(Association for Computing Machinery) License! There are more than 50,000 contents around computer science, and I'm excited to learn a lot from here. Here are some books I'm now reading.

* How Linux Works, 3rd Edition By Brian Ward
* CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide, Fourth Edition, 4th Edition


### ✌️ Tdd with Golang!
I found [learn-go-with-tests](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests) for my study. This is two of the most interested topics for me. TDD and Golang. I'll go through this soon.
