## 🔥 Work
### 🔒 Docker + Nginx + Https + Certbot 
For my client, we have a small web server on docker with nginx. Once, I've set the https configs following [DigitalOcean's article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-a-containerized-node-js-application-with-nginx-let-s-encrypt-and-docker-compose) but the update of the certification on cronjobs does not work well. So, I've researched some and find this nice OSS, [docker-nginx-certbot](https://github.com/JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot). It has shell scripts to do periodic updates, generation of dhparam keys, and staging mode, so it is so easy to switch from the DO example to this one.

## 🌱 Life
### ⚖️  心技体(Spirit, Skill, Body)
When I watch the action film "The Equalizer" on the Netflix, I heard the protagonist mentioned, "Body, Mind, and Spirit." several times. I don't know where the saying comes from, but noticed it is so similar to "心技体"(Shin-Gi-Tai, Spirit, Skill, and Body) in Japanese. It means those balances are principal to be successful. When I look back my daily life, I invest time in 技(skill) and 体(body), but not in 心(Spirit). So, nowadays I'm looking for how to train my spirit for a better life. 

### 🌂 Tsuyu(梅雨)
Tsuyu(梅雨) is a rainy season in Tokyo. I was born in Sapporo, northern area of Japan, that doesn't Tsuyu, so I'm still not used to it. Also, my schedule of running 100km every month is messed up😩.

## ✍ Study
### 📝 Neovim Progress!
Like I've mentioned in the last week blog, I'm the newbie of the Vim(Neovim) editor. I understand there are Buffers, Tabs, and Windows in Vim from [this article](https://dev.to/iggredible/using-buffers-windows-and-tabs-efficiently-in-vim-56jc) and [vim-airline's](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) smarter tab line feature enables me to go through different buffers as IDE. Also, I understand Leader, really an extensible feature of Vim, makes easier to open nerdtree, and vim-fzf!
